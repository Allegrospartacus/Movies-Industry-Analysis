# Movies-Industry-Analysis
Project Overview
This project conducts an in-depth analysis of the movie industry using a dataset that includes various features such as movie names, ratings, genres, budget, gross earnings, and more. The goal is to explore relationships between different attributes and uncover insights into the factors that contribute to a movie's financial success, trends in the industry, and other interesting findings.

Key Steps in the Analysis

Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and converted data types for proper analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Investigated patterns in the dataset, including distributions of ratings, genres, and countries producing the most films.
Correlation Analysis: Analyzed relationships between numeric and categorical features to understand which factors, such as budget or votes, are closely tied to gross revenue.
Feature Transformation: Applied categorical encoding and correlation matrix generation to explore deeper connections among features.
Predictive Insights:
Strong Correlations: Identified strong positive correlations between budget, votes, and gross revenue, showing that higher budgets and more votes typically lead to higher earnings.
Top Performers: Listed the top-rated movies and companies by gross revenue.
Notable Results

Budget and Revenue: Strong correlation (0.74) between movie budgets and gross revenue.
Genre Analysis: Analyzed the gross revenue for each genre, highlighting top-performing genres.
Top Contributors: Identified top stars, directors, and companies based on their contribution to total gross revenue.
